# Control Board

## Overview

At the moment we have a series of 3 Stepper motors connected to 3 Polulu modules via a break outboard to an Arduino.
This system uses Gerbel on the Arduino for the firmware

  * Arduino - Replace with Arm Due (Bob mentioned he has a badge with the processor on we can use)
  * Stepper Motors / Polulu Modules - Keep these for re-use
  * Breakout Board - Replace with a custom breakout board including a driver / opto decoupler for the inductive sensor
  * Gerbel -> Replace this with the TinyG firmware (accepts G-Code)

## TODO

  * Add in circuit diagram of existing break out board
  * Instructions for compiling TinyG
  * New breakout board circuit
