# Firmware

The firmware in use is closely tied to the tyoe of hardware we use for the controller board.
The original board uses a standard 8 bit Arduino with a shield for several Pololu modules.

One of the important features with a CNC is motion control. When moving from one point to the next
it's best to ramp up the speed, then ramp it back down again instead of suddently starting and stopping.




32bit Arm processors typically have a greater degree of motion control
